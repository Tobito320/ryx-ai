# Enable legacy peer deps to resolve react-scripts@5.0.1 and typescript@5.x conflict.
# This is a temporary workaround until react-scripts officially supports TypeScript 5.x.
# Alternative solutions:
# - Downgrade typescript to ^4.9.5 to match react-scripts peer dep
# - Migrate to Vite or another build tool with better TypeScript 5.x support
