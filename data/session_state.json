If you want to change the default editor, you can do so by setting the `EDITOR` environment variable:\n\n```bash\nexport EDITOR=your_preferred_editor\n```\n\nReplace `your_preferred_editor` with the name of your preferred text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`, `emacs`, etc.)."

First, create or edit the script in your preferred editor. Since you have nvim as your preferred editor, use the following command to open and edit the script:\n\n```bash\nnvim /usr/local/bin/myscript\n```\n\n2. After creating or editing the script, make sure it's executable by running this command:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x /usr/local/bin/myscript\n```\n\n3. Now, create a systemd service file for your script. Create the service file using the following command:\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/systemd/system/myscript.service\n```\n\n4. Paste the following content into the newly created service file and save it:\n\n```bash\n[Unit]\nDescription=My custom script\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=/usr/local/bin/myscript\nRestart=always\nUser=yourusername\nStandardOutput=syslog\nStandardError=syslog\nSyslogIdentifier=myscript\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\nReplace `yourusername` with your actual username.\n\n5. Reload the systemd daemon to apply changes:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\n```\n\n6. Enable and start the service:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl enable myscript\nsudo systemctl start myscript\n```\n\nNow, your script should run automatically at boot time. You can check its status with this command:\n\n```bash\nsystemctl status myscript\n```"

Add the following line at the end of the file:\n\n```bash\nalias help='zsh -c \"compgen -A command --help | less\"'\n```\n\nThis alias uses `compgen` to list all available commands with their help descriptions and pipes them through `less`, a pager utility, for easier reading.
