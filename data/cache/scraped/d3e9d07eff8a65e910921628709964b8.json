It also offers tiling capabilities, like GNU Screen or tmux. Installation Install the kitty package. Usage New tabs and windows can be created and resized through various Ctrl+Shift shortcuts. Layouts are switchable through Ctrl+Shift+l and can be saved/restored. A full keyboard mode provides distinction between ambiguous keys like Ctrl+i vs Tab. Moreover, new text effects like curly-underline are also available for applications that support it. Kittens kitty has a framework for creating subprograms called kittens. The commands for all kittens are prefixed with kitty +kitten, so it is convenient to use them as shell aliases. icat This kitten is based on the kitty graphics protocol. It needs ImageMagick to be installed. To show an image in the terminal: $ kitty +kitten icat image.jpg It can also display animated gifs in the terminal. Instead of an image file, you can pass a directory or an image url. This also works over ssh to display images from a remote server. Several applications such as ranger and neofetchAUR use this protocol for displaying images in the terminal. For more information, see the official documentation diff This kitten requires either git or diffutils to be installed. Optionally, install python-pygments for syntax highlighting. To show a diff of two files: $ kitty +kitten diff file1 file2 It displays diffs for images as well as text files. This kitten can also be used over ssh. You can pass directories instead of files for a recursive diff. For more information, see the official documentation. clipboard This kitten is used to read and write to the system clipboard and can be used to work with a clipboard even over ssh. To copy stdin to the system clipboard: $ echo \"Hello\" | kitty +kitten clipboard To output the current clipboard contents to stdout: $ kitty +kitten clipboard --get-clipboard This command will show a permission popup by default. To disable this, edit the clipboard_control option in the configuration file: ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf clipboard_control write-clipboard read-clipboard For more information, see the official documentation. Configuration kitty stores its configuration in ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf and the default configuration can be found at /usr/share/doc/kitty/kitty.conf. Fonts, colors, cursors and scrollback behaviors can be adjusted. You can see all available options in the official documentation or kitty.conf(5). Note If you are editing the default configuration with vim, the sections will begin folded. Each section can be expanded by using zo in normal mode. Tip The default configuration file at /usr/share/doc/kitty/kitty.conf is self-documenting with comments explaining each option. The official documentation is available locally at /usr/share/doc/kitty/html/index.html. Tips and Tricks Enable IME support This article or section is being considered for removal. Reason: See Special:Diff/829753 this might not be needed anymore? No references for the fix anywhere. (Discuss in Talk:Kitty) Kitty support for IBus IME framework is disabled by default. To enable it, set the environment variable GLFW_IM_MODULE=ibus. This will also work with Fcitx5 due to the compatible IBus interface that it offers. Single instance mode This works similar to a daemon mode. When kitty is launched with the --single-instance or -1 option, only one instance of kitty will run. Launching kitty subsequently with the same option will create a new window of the existing kitty instance. This will lower memory usage because of a shared GPU cache and also reduces startup time. You can have multiple groups of kitty instances with --instance group name option. See kitty(1) \u00a7\u202fsingle for more information. Troubleshooting Terminal issue",
