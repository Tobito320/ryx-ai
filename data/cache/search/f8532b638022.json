How memory is allocated to different function calls inrecursion?Recursionuses more memory to store data of every recursive call in an internal function call stack. Whenever we call a function, its record is added to the stack and remains there until the call is finished."

      "content": "Recursionis the process a procedure goes through when one of the steps of the procedure involves invoking the procedure itself. A procedure that goes throughrecursionis said to be 'recursive'. [3] To understandrecursion, one must recognize the distinction between a procedure and the running of a procedure."
