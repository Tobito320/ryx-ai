      "content": "A large language model (LLM) is a language model trained withself-supervised machinelearningon a vast amount of text, designed for natural language processing tasks, especially language generation. [1][2] The largest and most capable LLMs are generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and provide the core capabilities of modern chatbots."

      "content": "We address the main problem ofself-learningLLM: the question of what to learn. We propose aself-learningLLM framework that enables an LLM to independently learn previously unknown knowledge throughself-assessment of their own hallucinations. We introduce a concept called Point in the Unknown (PiU) to identify atomic knowledge unknown to a model, along with four methods for automatic PiUs ..."
