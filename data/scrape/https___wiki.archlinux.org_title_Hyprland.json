Noteworthy features of Hyprland include dynamic tiling, tabbed windows, a clean and readable C++ code-base, and a custom renderer that provides window animations, rounded corners, and Dual-Kawase Blur on transparent windows. General usage and configuration is thoroughly documented atHyprland wiki.\nInstallation\nInstallthehyprlandpackage.\nAs of#6608, Hyprland usesaquamarineas its own rendering backend library. Before that, it bundled its own version ofwlroots, which closely followedwlroots-gitAUR.\nNVIDIAGPU users should also make sure to follow the NVIDIA specific page on theupstream Wikibefore trying to launch Hyprland. Failure to do so will likely result in many bugs including not being able to log in, flashing windows and high CPU usage.\nUsing an NVIDIA GPU with Hyprland is unsupported. Many users have had success but if something is broken then you are on your own.\nMake sure to install thePolkitpackage, orstartandenableseatd.service. As the lack thereof will cause Hyprland to fail to start.\nseatd.service\nFor Vmware/VirtualBox users, it may be necessary to enable 3D acceleration in order to run Hyprland properly.\nConfiguration\nConfiguration is done through a single configuration file,hyprland.conf, though it supports splitting the configuration into multiple files and including them inhyprland.conf. The default file is/usr/share/hypr/hyprland.confand, after logging in for the first time,~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf.\nhyprland.conf\n/usr/share/hypr/hyprland.conf\n~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf\nhyprland.confincludes directives to configure your devices (keyboards, mice, trackpads, monitors), as well as settings for animations, decorations, layout, etc. You can set key bindings, window rules, and execute commands (either once or each time) the configuration is reloaded.\nhyprland.conf\nThe configuration is automatically reloaded each time you update the file. You can also usehyprctl reloadfor the same effect. For some settings (particularly input settings), you may have to restart your Hyprland session.\nhyprctl reload\nSettings can also be changed on the fly withhyprctlbut they will not be saved.\nKeyboard\nBy default Hyprland will useUS Qwerty, you can configure it as follows:\nUS Qwerty\n~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf\n# German Colemak layout\ninput {\n    ...\n    kb_layout = de\n    kb_variant = colemak\n    ...\n    }\nSeeupstream's Wikifor all available options.\nUS\nWhile Xorg users will be used to having this settingdefined at the server level, on Wayland each compositor handles it on its own:\n~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf\n# Repeat rate and delay\ninput {\n    ...\n    repeat_rate = 25\n    repeat_delay = 600\n    ...\n    }\nUsing keyboard brightness controls in Hyprland is possible.Installbrightnessctlthen add the related binds (replacekeyboard_brightness_*withSUPER, FXorXF86KbdBrightnessdepending on how your hardware exposes thekeyboard backlight):\nkeyboard_brightness_*\nSUPER, FX\nXF86KbdBrightness\n~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf\n# Keyboard backlight\nbind = ,keyboard_brightness_up_shortcut, exec, brightnessctl -d *::kbd_backlight set +33%\nbind = ,keyboard_brightness_down_shortcut, exec, brightnessctl -d *::kbd_backlight set 33%-\nIt is also possible to haveon-screen notificationsthat fire when changes are made.\nUsing keyboard media controls in Hyprland is possible by making use ofXF86Audiokeysyms and an external application likepavucontrolorpamixerandplayerctl:\nXF86Audio\n~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf\n# Volume and Media Control\nbind = , XF86AudioRaiseVolume, exec, pamixer -i 5 \nbind = , XF86AudioLowerVolume, exec, pamixer -d 5 \nbind = , XF86AudioMicMute, exec, pamixer --default-source -m\nbind = , XF86AudioMute, exec, pamixer -t\nbind = , XF86AudioPlay, exec, playerctl play-pause\nbind = , XF86AudioPause, exec, playerctl play-pause\nbind = , XF86AudioNext, exec, playerctl next\nbind = , XF86AudioPrev, exec, playerctl previous\nIt is also possible to haveon-screen notificationsthat fire when changes are made.\nTouchpad gestures\nBeing aWaylandcompositor, Hyprland has full support for touchpad gestures though they are disabled by default. To enable them, make the following edit:\n~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf\n# Enable touchpad gestures\ngesture = 3, horizontal, workspace\nSee theupstream Wikifor all available options.\nDisplay settings\nSeeScreen-sharing\nBeing a wlroots-compatible compositor, Hyprland can utilizexdg-desktop-portal-wlrto enable screen capture in a range of applications by way ofxdg-desktop-portal.\nHyprland also maintainsxdg-desktop-portal-hyprland, which supports screen sharing (including region sharing and window sharing), global shortcuts, and has a graphical picker utility. Usage of the portal is further documented in theHyprland wiki.\nIt is worth noting that xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland does not include a file picker, for which users can additionally installxdg-desktop-portal-gtk.\nHyprland will try to detect your screen resolution automatically and then select either 1x, 1.5x, or 2x screen scaling.[1]However, in some cases it will fail and default to a fail-safe, usually if there are multiple screens present or if you have a hybrid laptop. If everything on your screen is huge then you need to configure your default monitor and resolution.\nFirst find your default monitor usinghyprctl:\n$ hyprctl monitors\nMonitoreDP-1(ID 0):1920x1080@144.003006 at0x0description: Chimei Innolux Corporation 0x153C (eDP-1)\n        ...\nThen add your monitor to the configuration:\n~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf\n...\n# Monitor details\nmonitorv2 {\n    output = eDP-1\n    mode = 1920x1080@144\n    position = 0x0\n    scale = 1\n}\n...\n0x0is a position offset used for multi screen setups and the final1is the screen scaling factor.\n0x0\n1\nSee theupstream Hyprland Monitors Wikifor more details.\nThere is thenwg-displayspackage, a GUI application for monitor arrangement, that supports Hyprland. It is part of thenwg-shell(but works standalone), seenwg-displays githubfor more details.\nInstallbrightnessctlthen add the following binds:\n~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf\n# Screen brightness\nbind = , XF86MonBrightnessUp, exec, brightnessctl s +5%\nbind = , XF86MonBrightnessDown, exec, brightnessctl s 5%-\nIt is also possible to haveon-screen notificationsthat fire when changes are made.\nUsage\nStarting\nUniversal Wayland Session Managerwraps the compositor and accordingly configured applications and daemons through systemd unit files, allowing you to control them withsystemctl.\nHyprland can be started via aDisplay managerwithuwsmby selectinghyprland (uwsm-managed).\nYou can start Hyprland with uwsm both in agettyvia the following script in yourlogin shell:\nif uwsm check may-start && uwsm select; then\n  exec systemd-cat -t uwsm_start uwsm start default\nfi\nuwsm check may-startchecks whether it is OK to launch a wayland session, in particular if it is running from alogin shell. However, you should still avoid using it inside.bashrcor other files which are sourced even by nonlogin shells.\nuwsm check may-start\n.bashrc\nHyprland no longerrecommendsstarting your session withuwsmas it is considered experimental and intended for advanced users who understand its implications andquirks.\nif uwsm check may-start; then\n  exec uwsm start hyprland.desktop\nfi\nyou must avoid using theexitdispatcher or terminate the Hyprland process directly since this would interfere with the normal shutdown process. Use insteaduwsm stoporloginctl terminate-user \"\"to terminate Hyprland and exit user session, for example:\nexit\nuwsm stop\nloginctl terminate-user \"\"\n~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf\nbind = $mainMod, M, exec, uwsm stop\nDo not put environment variables inhyprland.conf, but use insteaduwsmfiles~/.config/uwsm/envfor variables common to all graphical sessions managed by uwsm (GTK, Qt, xcursor, ...) and~/.config/uwsm/env-hyprlandfor Hyprland exclusive environment variables (HYPR*andAQ_*variables for example). The format of these files isexportKEY=VALUEon each line without comments. It is strongly suggested, if you use multiple GPUs, to put the environment variableAQ_DRM_DEVICESinsideenv-hyprlandin order to avoid conflicts with other compositors.\nhyprland.conf\n~/.config/uwsm/env\n~/.config/uwsm/env-hyprland\nHYPR*\nAQ_*\nexportKEY=VALUE\nAQ_DRM_DEVICES\nenv-hyprland\nYou can start Hyprland from agettywith the following command:\n$ Hyprland\nWhile launching from adisplay manageris not officially supported, users have reported success launching fromGDM,SDDM, and others. Theupstream wikimaintains a compatibility list with display managers. Thehyprlandpackage contains twodesktop entries, and all Hyprland AUR packages will generate one automatically.\nBoth methods provide identical results, plus or minus a few environment variables and services.\nUsers can automatically login by using adisplay manageror adapting the method described inXinit#Autostart X at login.\nhyprctl and IPC\nhyprctlis a command line utility that comes installed with Hyprland to communicate with the display server. It allows you to dispatch commands to the server (equivalent to commands in the configuration file, but with a slightly different syntax), set keywords, send queries and request information. See thefull documentation.\nHyprland also exposes2 UNIX Socketsfor controlling and getting information about Hyprland via code or command-line utilities. These sockets broadcast events on focus change (windows, workspaces, monitors), creation of windows/workspace, and so on.\nBothhyprctland the IPC sockets can be effectively used in scripts to control Hyprland for complex tasks.\nAutostart\nWhen starting applications it is important to use the correct type of dispatcher, usingexecincorrectly can result in applications being started multiple times taking up system resources and in the worst cases, causing a race condition that can crash your system.\nexec\nhyprland.conf\nexec\nexec-once\nexec\nuwsm app\n~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf\nexec-once = uwsm app -- mycommand --arg1 --arg2\nbind ",
